Short Guide to Genetic Algorithms
=================================

Code for my demo at @SoftwareNiagara's DevTricks (June 9, 2014).

[Join us on the **second monday of every month**][devtricks] at our casual
meetup where developers share their tips, tricks, and knowledge.

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)

A genetic algorithm is a search technique inspired by Darwin's *Theory of Evolution*
and is used in computing to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization
and search problems.

GAs are mainly used for problems where *satisficing* is expected. A good
solution is satisfactory, and there is little benefit to be gained by going for
an expensive optimal solution.

### Touring Singer Problem (TSP)

A musician is expected to make a round trip at all the venues she'll be
performing at, before returning home. This musician likes to be efficient, and
wants to minimize her time on the road. A short route would help a lot...
